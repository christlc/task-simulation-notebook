# task-simulation-notebook

This consists of a task simulation jupyter notebook that simulates a single queue with one server. 

When the task arrvial and task length are exponential (M/M/1 queue), there is a ratio between total time(lead time+task time) and utilization(U), i.e. 1/(1-U).

Therefore, when U=0.9, the total time is 10x of the typical task time. U=0.5, the total time is 2x of the typical task time.
